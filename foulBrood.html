    <h1>Something Smells Foul</h1>
    <p>FoulBrood, 4 different diseases that directly attack brood chambers of bee hives.
        Consisting of American Foulbrood, European Foulbrood, Chalkbrood and Stonebrood.
        The following table can help differentiate between the American and European Foulbrood.

    <h2>Treatments</h2>
    <p>A majority of states by law require you to contact the state beekeepers association
        to report foulbrood. With the spores able to be viable for nearly 80 years the only real solution
        is to burn all hive bodies and frames that have been infected with foulbrood. 
    </p>
    <h2>Chalkbrood</h2>
    <p>A fungal disease that attacks the gut of larvae, eventually starving them to death
        and giving them to appear chalky or white.
        Chalkbrood is mainly seen in early spring in wet conditions, ventalition is key in to preventing
        and treating Chalkbrood.
    </p>
    <h2>Stonebrood</h2>
    <p>Not as common as other fungal diseases, can be somewhat difficult to identify in early stages.
        Can form a collar like ring around the head of the larvae, after death they turn black and 
        are difficult to crush. Hence the name. Strong colonies are able to treat this by disposing 
        of the larvae that are infected by the fungal spores.
