    <h1>Wax Moths/Wax Worms</h1>
    <p>Believe it or not, a moth can be a devastating pest to any beehive. Just 1 singular wax 
        moth can slip in the hive in the night, lay eggs and leave. This larvae can chew through
        comb and destroy entire brood frames. This in turn can cause the hive to abandon the nest
        and leave. Luckily preventing the wax moth isnt as difficult as other pests. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ways to stop and prevent</h2>
    <p>A strong hive will easily take care of wax moth larvae, even if the moth is able to breach 
        the hive and lay eggs they will immediatly be taken out and discarded. If you suspect that
        a frame has wax moth eggs then take the frame and put it in your freezer for 2 days. This will
        kill eggs in the frame.
